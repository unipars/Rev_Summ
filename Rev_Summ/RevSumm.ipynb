Nice reception and bar area (although bar was VERY brightly lit like an airport waiting lounge, could be lovely with lights dimmed, decor very tasteful). Friendly lady on reception. Long way to room, bit like a maze and we noticed on the way that the carpets on all the stairs and corridors needed a darn good vaccuuming. Room quite pleasant but window frame had quite a lot of black mould around the inside and some wallpaper peeling off in corner with more black mould underneath. They've skimped so much on the fabric of the (new) curtains that they didn't cover the window when closed, something I've never seen before in a hotel! We found it funny...very Fawlty Towers. Carpet HAD been vaccuumed and bathroom clean but more black mould in grout on bath tiles. Room quiet, beds very comfy (and clean). Didn't try restaurant but cooked breakfast was good. We also had a giggle in the bar with the friendly locals giving advice about where to visit in the area. Cabaret singer had a great voice but he was VERY cheesy...unexpected treat of Scottish dancers. All in all an ok stay...could be lovely with its size and location but needs to be cleaner/more atmospheric/pay more attention to detail.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["ut.extract_opinion(review)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"TyKuoJgOYKcI","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1685002872001,"user_tz":-210,"elapsed":10409,"user":{"displayName":"Robin Hood II","userId":"15281786826216599467"}},"outputId":"13d5579a-abeb-47e9-f1f6-3f16e87c775f"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["The review has 1271 words.\n","Cleanliness:\n","- Carpets on stairs and corridors needed vacuuming.\n","- Window frame had black mold and wallpaper peeling off in the room.\n","- Curtains were not able to cover the window when closed.\n","- Black mold in grout on bath tiles.\n","\n","Staff:\n","- Friendly lady on reception.\n","- Friendly locals in the bar giving advice on the area.\n","- Cabaret singer had a great voice, but was very cheesy.\n","- Scottish dancers were an unexpected treat.\n","\n","Food & Restaurant:\n","- Cooked breakfast was good.\n","\n","Dear [Customer Name],\n","\n","Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts about your recent stay at our hotel.
